1. Setup Project Directory --> done
- create folders src, data, and models --> done
- create requirements.txt for python dependencies, and README.md(might be this file) --> done
2. Clone YOLOv5 Repository
- Clone the YOLOv5 repo into your project directory --> done
3. Install dependencies --> done
- Use requirements.txt to list all necessary libraries
- OpenCV
-PyTorch
-YOLOv5 specific packages
- Install dependencies --> done
4. Start with a pre-trained model  --> done
-download one from repo 
5. Develop Core Object Detection Functionality
- Set up python script that initializes webcam (internal cam) to capture video frames.
Step 1:
Problem/Scope
I want to detect people, small objects.
I want to process through a live video feed
Step 2:
Prepare the Pre-Trained Model for Inference
Use Pre-trained model
smaller models peform better for real-time
Figure out more differences before moving on ahead.
larger models slower but better accuracy.
Load the Model
Set Inference Config
Prepare Input
Set up Preprocessing
- Implement functionality to process each frame 
Step 3:
Capture video or image feed
Run object detection on each frame using YOLOv5

6. Post-process Detection Results
- Extract bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class labels from model's predictions.
- Apply non-maximum suppression (NMS) to filter overlapping detection (do this maybe)
7. Visualize Detection Results
- Draw bounding boxes, labels, confidence scores on video frames (cool part)
- Display the processed frames with detections in real-time.
8. Test System
- Run object detection system with live webcam feed (IR Camera?)
- Verify that system is correctly identifying and labeling objects in real-time.
9. Update README.md 
10. Deploy Application (DONE!!!)
